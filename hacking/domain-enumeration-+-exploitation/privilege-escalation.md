# Privilege Escalation

## Process Elevation (via SeDebugPrivilege)

If you run `whoami /priv` and you see `SeDebugPrivilege` set to `Enabled`, you can assume you already have SYSTEM. One way of doing it, is using [decoder](https://twitter.com/decoder\_it)'s `psgetsys.ps1` [script](https://github.com/decoder-it/psgetsystem) once you have a good idea on a PID to inject: `. .\psgetsys.ps1; [MyProcess]::CreateProcessFromParent(7864, 'C:\temp\burmat443.exe');` You can also gain a MSF session and use the module `windows/manage/payload_inject` with a PID of your choice.
