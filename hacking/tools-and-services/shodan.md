# Shodan

## üìñ Basic Usage Scenarios and Queries:

Shodan is a great source to begin looking for hosts that the parent organization owns. Shodan aggregates this information by banner grabbing and collecting information being leaked by insecure devices. The discovered information is then categorized and stored in a large database that users can search by type of device, brand name, operating system, location, and more. It is important to note that to use Shodan, you must have an account.

### ‚õπÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Basic Usage

For this example, we will leverage Shodan‚Äôs search engine. Our first search is a generic organization search to see what we can find on the organization using the following command:

* `org:"Organization_Name"`

This usually only returns a hand full of results, but it is still important to mention. To take it a step further, we will leverage Shodan‚Äôs SSL certificate searching function. To minimize the potential for stale records, we will have Shodan only return IP‚Äôs that respond with a 200 status code using the following command:

* `ssl:"Organization_Name" 200`

To show the amount of noise you get when searching without the 200 status code included, I queried Shodan against the organization ‚Äúburmat.co‚Äù. Without specifying the required 200 status code, the query returned 152 results. With the required 200 status code, it returned only 7 results.
